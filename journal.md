Coding Journal to keep track of notes 



##First Journal April 5th
{
    #First thoughts:
        - apparently genius api is available so look into that
        - musixmatch api and spotify api is necessary 
        - figure out what dependencies I need.
        - I shouldn't actually need a server I don't think? But I'll prob add one cause I want to


    #GOALS:
        - get back into the swing of things
        - Start doing at least one toy problem per week once I get comfortable
        
        - Make an app that will be actually useful for me trying to build playlists. 
            - good search methods (genre, subject matter etc.)
            - readily available info (like song lyrics, facts etc.)

        - Make an app that does some interesting autogenerations of song playlists.
            - utilize good search methods to create highly specific and hopefully relevent auto generated playlists for people.
